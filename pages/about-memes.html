      <h2>What are memes?</h2>
      <p>Memes and social media are perfect for each other.
      </p>
      <p>Both concepts are about connecting with people online. While social
        media
        is a platform for communication, memes are a way of expressing a
        culturally-relevant idea. A meme is an image or video that represents
        the
        thoughts and feelings of a specific audience.
      </p>
      <p>Most memes are captioned photos intended to elicit humor. However,
        there
        are many viral video memes too.</p>
      <p>Memes are a worldwide social phenomenon, and an increasingly important
        aspect of viral marketing and social engagement. Memes often relate to
        existing cultures or subcultures. Often, memes spread rapidly through
        social media, email, and forum boards.

      <h2>Why do we use them?</h2>
      <p>If you got this far, you probably understand what memes are, so the
        next question in line is, why do so many people use them around the
        world every day? Simply put, they are the internet's inside jokes. They
        convey a feeling of familiarity and relevance, being a part of something
        bigger. The cultural knowledge you gained from years of watching
        television and browsing social media channels has now made it possible
        for you to understand and enjoy this joke. That's the secret ingredient
        that turns memes from regular jokes to viral material.
      </p>
      <p>There are few more reasons why memes are one of the go-to moves of the
        average social media user:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>They are eye-catching.</li>
        <li>They enable you to express complex ideas through a simple concept by
          relying on the meme context, origin and common use.</li>
        <li>They have a viral potential.</li>
        <li>They push you to paint your creative thoughts in more humorous
          colors.</li>
        <li>They are easy to create and are just too much fun! </li>
      </ul>
